# valour-wp-gallery
My attempt to create a WordPress gallery plugin other WordPress developers can easily modify and install on their WordPress websites.

The current WordPress Gallery Plugins cannot satisfy all our needs. There are always going to be one or two features we will wish it'll have so, going through the trouble of finding a plugin that will meet all these needs becomes time consuming and sometimes, impossible.

This project presents a WordPress Gallery Plugin that is simple to modify cos it has less code than normal projects and a lot of the features are coded from scratch so they can easily be modified. It still relies heavily on internal WordPress functions and classes though.

Please feel free to make suggestions for features and options in the code that modify the behaviour in certain ways. The plugin has default functionality for those who don't want to do any coding. However, if you want to go in and tweek, ensure you've got PHP, HTML/CSS and JavaScript/jQuery knowledge.

Please suggest better ways to secure the code so people's websites are not jeopardized by installing it.

Please take the terms for the license attached seriously.

Thank you very much.
